You can embed live streams, video on demand (VOD), and clips in a website. Embedded video windows must be at least 400x300 pixels.

There are three types of VODs:

Past broadcasts are created automatically from a live stream.
Highlights can be created by broadcasters from past broadcasts.
Uploads are external videos that are added to Twitch using the Video Uploads API or the Video Manager.
This guide discusses three techniques for embedding video and clips

Embedding live streams and VODs in a non-interactive frame.
Embedding live streams and VODs in an interactive iframe.
Embedding clips in a non-interactive frame.
For more information, see Video on Demand and How to Use Clips .

Non-Interactive Inline Frames for Live Streams and VODs

Iframe Attributes
These attributes are defined in the IFrame element. The Twitch player can not set or modify them.

Name	Type	Description
allowfullscreen	boolean	A boolean attribute set by inclusion. In other words, including the attribute enables fullscreen viewing while excluding the attribute ensures fullscreen viewing is not allowed.
height	number or string	Height of the embedded window, in pixels. This can be expressed as a percentage as well, by passing a string like 100%. Minimum: 300
parent	string	Required. Domain(s) that will be embedding Twitch. You must have one parent key for each domain your site uses.
src	string	The iframe src URL string should be https://player.twitch.tv/ with one of these required query string parameters:

channel – (string) Name of the channel, for a live stream.

video – (string) Video ID (for past broadcasts, highlights, and video uploads). In this context (the video player), the video ID must have a “v” prefix.

collection - (string) Collection ID, for a collection of videos.

If both video and collection are specified, the specified collection starts playing from the specified video. If the video is not in the collection, collection is ignored and the specified video is played.

If channel is specified along with video and/or collection, only channel is used.
width	number or string	Width of the embedded window, in pixels. This can be expressed as a percentage as well, by passing a string like 50%. Minimum: 400
Optional Query String Parameters on Iframe src
Name	Type	Description
autoplay	boolean	If true, the video starts playing automatically, without the viewer clicking play. Minimum size requirements and visibility are necessary for autoplay to begin. The exception is mobile devices, on which video cannot be played without user interaction. Default: true.
muted	boolean	Specifies whether the initial state of the video is muted. Default: false.
time	1h2m3s	Time in the video where playback starts. Specifies hours, minutes, and seconds. Default: 0h0m0s (the start of the video).
Video Metadata
Video information such as duration, view count, and associated Twitch channel is available via the Get Videos API endpoint.

Examples
Using a channel name:

<iframe
    src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=dallas&parent=streamernews.example.com&muted=true"
    height="720"
    width="1280"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
Using a video ID:

<iframe
    src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v40464143&parent=streamernews.example.com&autoplay=false"
    height="720"
    width="1280"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
Using a collection ID:

<iframe
    src="https://player.twitch.tv/?collection=abcDeF1ghIJ2kL&parent=streamernews.example.com"
    height="720"
    width="1280"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

<div id="<player div ID>"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var options = {
    width: <width>,
    height: <height>,
    channel: "<channel ID>",
    video: "<video ID>",
    collection: "<collection ID>",
    // only needed if your site is also embedded on embed.example.com and othersite.example.com

Non-Interactive IFrames for Clips
Embedding a Clip is different than embedding a live stream or VOD. The embedded Clips player uses a different set of query parameters and does not support the JavaScript interactive embed.
